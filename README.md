# Snowpack + Svelte + SSR

This is a not-totally-functional experiment to see what it would take to use [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) as a base for [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Rich-Harris/snowpack-svelte
cd snowpack-svelte
npm install

npm start
```
